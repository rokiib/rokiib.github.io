        aboutText: "I started my career in 2017 as a Customer Service Associate, and it didn't take long for me to discover the power of Excel. I still remember the first time I updated a file that helped over 200 colleagues serve customers more smoothly‚Äîit felt like I'd found a superpower. That spark led me to explore data analytics in 2021. Since then, I've been learning and applying tools like Power BI and SQL to solve real-world problems, whether at work, in organizations I collaborate with, or even for friends and family. My goal is simple: turn everyday data into insights that make decisions easier and processes smarter."
